# Sales_Prediction
Sales prediction using Linear Regression and Random Forest in Python involves utilizing machine learning algorithms to forecast future sales based on historical data.

Linear Regression models the relationship between the independent variables (such as advertising expenditure, seasonality, etc.) and the dependent variable (sales) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. It assumes a linear relationship between the variables.

Random Forest, on the other hand, is an ensemble learning technique that creates a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the average prediction of the individual trees. It's capable of capturing complex relationships between variables and tends to perform well with noisy and non-linear data.

In Python, you would typically:

1. Prepare your data, including features (independent variables) and the target variable (sales).
2. Split your data into training and testing sets.
3. Train both a Linear Regression model and a Random Forest model using the training data.
4. Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared.
5. Use the trained models to predict sales on new data.
